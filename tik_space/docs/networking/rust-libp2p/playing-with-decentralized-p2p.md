# Playing with decentralized p2p network & Rust Libp2p Stacks
---

## üß† Author's Journey & Motivation

* The author embarked on a personal project to explore decentralized P2P networks in Rust, motivated by use cases related to Web3 and decentralized systems ([Medium][1]).
* They appreciate Rust‚Äôs growing ecosystem in blockchain (e.g. Solana, Polkadot, NEAR) and its performance, type safety, and Cargo tooling.

---

## Key Concepts & Technologies Used

* **rust-libp2p** ‚Äî a modular, mature P2P networking stack in Rust ([Medium][2], [GitHub][3]).
* **Core abstractions**:

    * **Swarm**: groups peers, manages connections and behaviors
    * **NetworkBehaviour**: defines logic for message handling and event processing
    * **Transport + multiplexing + encryption (Noise, TCP, Yamux/Mplex)** ([Red And Green][4]).
* **Discovery mechanisms**:

    * mDNS for local network peer discovery
    * Kademlia DHT and gossip protocols (like Gossipsub or Floodsub) for broader discovery and messaging ([Red And Green][4]).

---

## Hands-On Examples & Implementation Highlights

* The author implemented a small REST API (e.g. registration and login) to ground their learning using frameworks like Actix and core Rust language features: ownership, lifetimes, async, Cargo
  Workspace structure, references with `Box`, `Arc`, etc. ([Medium][1]).
* An external reference (LogRocket blog) outlines building a CLI peer-to-peer recipe-sharing app in \~300 lines of Rust, covering:

    * Peer identity and topic-based pub/sub
    * Floodsub, mDNS, Swarm, and Tokio runtime usage
    * Event loop handling user input plus Swarm and response channels
    * Structuring commands like `ls peers`, `create r`, `publish r`, etc. ([LogRocket Blog][5])
* Notes from community discussions recommend evolving further:

    * Use **bootstrap nodes** to connect beyond the local network
    * Prefer **Request/Reply behavior** over Floodsub for targeted responses
    * Use **Gossipsub** instead of Floodsub for scalable propagation ([LogRocket Blog][5]).

## NAT Traversal & Connectivity Enhancements

* NAT traversal is supported primarily via **hole punching over dc‚ÄêUTR**, with roughly 60% success rate in practice ([libp2p][6]).
* The current versions of rust-libp2p support:

    * TCP with port reuse
    * QUIC
    * Websockets
    * WebRTC
    * Circuit relay v1/v2 (TURN‚Äëlike)
    * Direct connection upgrades through relay
    * AutoNAT
    * Parallel dialing strategies
    * UPnP support ([libp2p][6]).

---

## Recommended Learning Strategy

* Run and study official **rust‚Äëlibp2p examples**
* Build a minimal peer-to-peer app (e.g. file or message sharing between two nodes)
* Engage with examples for:

    * Configuration of libp2p transports and behaviors
    * Peer discovery
    * Message passing
    * Error/debug logging to observe Swarm events in practice ([libp2p][6], [LogRocket Blog][5]).
