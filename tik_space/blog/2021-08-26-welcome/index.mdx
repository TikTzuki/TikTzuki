Welcome to my personal blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts, projects, and learnings with you.

This blog is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static site generator that makes creating documentation and blogs a breeze. It comes with powerful features like [blog plugins](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog), MDX support, and much more.

## What Makes This Blog Special?

### Interactive Content with MDX

Unlike traditional Markdown, MDX lets me embed interactive React components directly in my posts. Check this out:

<button
    onClick={() => alert('You clicked the button! This is the power of MDX.')}
    style={{
        backgroundColor: '#25c2a0',
        color: 'white',
        padding: '12px 24px',
        border: 'none',
        borderRadius: '8px',
        cursor: 'pointer',
        fontSize: '16px',
        fontWeight: 'bold',
        marginBottom: '20px'
    }}
>
    Click me to see MDX in action!k
</button>

### Rich Formatting Options

I can use Docusaurus admonitions to highlight important information:

:::tip Pro Tip
MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. This means you can create truly interactive and engaging content!
:::

:::info Good to Know
Blog posts are just Markdown (or MDX) files in the `blog` directory. The date can be part of the filename or specified in the frontmatter.
:::

:::note
Regular blog authors can be managed in the `authors.yml` file for easy author attribution across posts.

## How It Works

### File Organization

Blog posts can be organized in two ways:

1. **Single file**: `2019-05-30-my-post.md`
2. **Folder structure**: `2019-05-30-my-post/index.md` (or `index.mdx`)

The folder approach is great for keeping related assets together:

### Code Examples

Syntax highlighting works beautifully for code snippets:

```jsx title="example-component.jsx"
function InteractiveButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Tagging System

Posts can be organized with tags (like `ai` and `archive` on this post) to help readers find related content easily.

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing posts about:

- AI and Machine Learning
- Software Development
- Tools and Productivity
- Learning Resources
- Personal Projects

:::caution Not Into Blogging?
If you're setting up Docusaurus and don't want a blog section, simply delete the `blog` directory and set `blog: false` in your `docusaurus.config.js`.
